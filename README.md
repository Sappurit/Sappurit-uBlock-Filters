# Sappurit-uBlock-Filters
I collected all codes from https://www.reddit.com/r/uBlockOrigin/                
Special thanks to all who contributed the hard works.                 
I have a very little knowledge of CSS.  
I will try my best to maintain these lists.

To add my filters into uBlock, just click the RAW button and copy those link to your uBlock Dashboard > Filter lists > Import
